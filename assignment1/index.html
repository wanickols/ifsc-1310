            <p>This is a website dedicated to the franchise of pokemon. Pokemon is a series which I personally am interested in, so I thought it'd be a good start for making websites.
            The pokemon website is split up into three ports, the show, the videogames, and the card game. I did not have as much time as I would have liked to create this site, but I am happy with it.

        <p> <img src="assets/img/show.jpg" alt="Pokemon indigo league"/>The great adventures of 10 year old Ash Ketchum, a young Pokémon Trainer from Pallet Town, as well as his best friend and everlasting companion Pikachu.
            Together, they venture through many regions: the traditional region of Kanto, the culturally rich Johto, the temperate region of Hoenn, the mystical region of Sinnoh,
            the advanced landscapes of Unova, Kalos, with it's many landmarks, and the splendor of the tropics of Alola. Along the way, they meet many new companions,
            many new friends and new rivals, while also competing in each regional league; as well as toppling evil organizations, and outsmarting the pesky and persistent Team Rocket.
            However, through all this, Ash's goal remains unchanged: to discover many new Pokémon, and to become regarded as the world's greatest Pokémon Master.

              <h4>The Categories</h4>
            <p><img src="assets/img/The-Best-Pokemon-Games-of-All-Time.jpg" alt="Pokemon Game Picture" id= "gamepic"/>The pokemon games have released many titles over the years so this might be a hard question. However, each game has things that define it as a pokemon game. Nintendo typically releases the newest
               game on the newest console avaible. Thus the console it can be played on can be seen as a time marker. It could also be defined by it's generation. Every few years pokemon gets a new generation. What this means is,
               a new set of pokemon added to the pokemon universe (note this is for the games as well as the series). Each pokemon game could be seen as a main title, derivative title, upper version, or remake.
               Each of these factors should tell alot about when it was made, and for most gamers, whether they would want to play it.<br><br>

              <h4>The story</h4>
            <p>The storyline of each main game is not the same but you will find some simularities. The game starts with a main character typically young in age. This character is just starting their pokemon journey.
               After learning the ropes, they are sent from town to town normally under the pretext of battling gym leaders, or collecting some sort of unique town item. Along the way they delve deeper into a evil plot
               of the bad guys (team skull). This eventually leads to the main character using there battle knowhow and pokemon to save the day.</p>

          <h3>The Birth</h3>
      
        <p>
          The pokemon card game was a trading card game built off the success of the anime and games.
          It has earned it's owned right as one of the categories because it's prominence in sales and
          household name. Many people collect the card's without ever watching the anime or playing the game.
          This shows the spread of this avenue to a different audience, ultimately serving as a wonderful
          collection for every pokemon that has existed.
