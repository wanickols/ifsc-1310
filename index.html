    <h3>Progressive Enhancement</h3>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement is the concept of building a website from the content up. All sites need content, and ultimately that is why sites are visited. Thus when making a website, starting with the basic content as a foundation is a natural mindset. Progressive Enhancement is to take the content of your website and format it in a basic form through html. From there, you would then add css to give it design and beautification. Finally, you would add special effects and functionality through javascript. The premise is that if a user can't use javascript, they still get css and html. If they can't use javascript or css, they still get html. </p>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>The dragon is the culmination of everything I learned this semester. I started my revision by looking over what you suggested, looking at a few headings and adjusting the "verticle rythm" which I found very cool. It made sense to have everything connected that way too. 
    I had my sister look at my website, and she commented on a few suggestions. She wanted a back to top button, which was easy to implement. She wished the faq's would all open at once, I decided to go with ones that close the others when you open one, she found that fine. She also asked the links go to below the header on each page so you could tell it was moving. The only suggestion I didn't take was that she wanted animation on the website (Like a little cartoon rocket). I had not clue how to put a cartoon rocket flying around on my page, nor did I want to spend the hours to find out when I have all my finals this week. 
    </p>
    <p>This semester I learned a lot. I wish I had more time to delve into javascript, but I'm sure sometime in the future I will. It was kind of a hectic semester for me, it was my first in college after all, but ultimately I am proud of what I accomplished in the class as well as others. If I had the chance to do it again I'd try to pay more attention to parts of the CSS lectures, I think I missed a lot going through them. Html made a lot of sense and was rather easy. I think conceptually I did pretty well overall. I think all I need is just more practice with everything, but that's everything in life. I don't think Web design will be my major nor my job title ever in the future, but it is a skill I was happy to learn and hope to build off it in the future. Thank you for teaching me :)</p>
